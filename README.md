# ChatAppReact
A casual chat-app made with local storage, react and fire-base.

In this version you are given a username and color scheme when you press join. This is saved in local storage so it does not last indefinetly.

The firebase database is deleted every 24 hours as well, but that was my personal preference. This is simply a demo project.
